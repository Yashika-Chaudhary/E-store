To run the solution follow the steps:

1) open phpmyadmin in browser and create a database "Estore".
2) Place this folder in www folder of wamp (htdocs for xampp)
3) In browser URL type - localhost/folder_name/create_table.php (This will create the required tables)
4) Then open phpmyadmin again click on items table insert the data
	- PID: 1
	- cart: 0
	- Price :(whatever you want)
(Like this add as many data, as you have 6 items to buy in order now - initially cart must be 0 and PID must start from 1 upto n)

5) Now everyhting is set and you can run the code by typing in URL localhost/Solution3/index.php
